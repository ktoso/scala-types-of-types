== Package Object
Package Objects have been added to Scala in 2.8 <<package-object>> and do not really extend the type system as such,
but they provide an pretty useful pattern for "importing a bunch of stuff together" as well as being one of the places
the compiler will look for implicit values.

Declaring a package object is as simple as using the keywords `package` and `object` in conjunction, such as:

```scala
// src/main/scala/com/garden/apples/package.scala

package com.garden

package object apples extends RedApples with GreenApples {
  val redApples = List(red1, red2)
  val greenApples = List(green1, green2)
}

trait RedApples {
  val red1, red2 = "red"
}

trait GreenApples {
  val green1, green2 = "green"
}
```

It's a custom to put package objects in a file called `package.scala` into the package they're the object for. Investigate the above example's 
source path and package to see what that means.

On the usage side, you get the real gains, because when you import "the package", you import any state that is defined in the package side along with it:

```scala
import com.garden.apples._

redApples foreach println
```
