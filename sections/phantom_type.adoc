== Phantom Type

Phantom Types are very true to it's name even if it's a weird one, and can be explained as "Types that are not instantiate, ever".
Instead of using them directly, we use them to even more strictly enforce some logic, using our types.

The example we'll look at is a `Service` class, which has `start` and `stop` methods. Now we want to guarantee that you cannot (the type system won't allow you to) start an already started service, and vice-versa.

Let's start with preparing our "marker traits", which don't contain any logic - we will only use them in order to express the state of an service in it's type:

```scala
sealed trait ServiceState
final class Started extends ServiceState
final class Stopped extends ServiceState
```

Note that making the `ServiceState` trait `sealed` assures that no one can suddenly add another state to our system.
We also define the leaf types here to be final, so no one can extend them, and add other states to the system.

[NOTE]
====
*The `sealed` keyword*

`sealed` makes sure that all classes that extend a class or trait are defined in the same compilation unit. For example, if you define `sealed trait State` and a few state implementations in the file _State.scala_ it'll work, however you cannot extends `State` from another file (like _MyStates.scala_).

Note that this applies directly to the Type the keyword was applied to, not to it's subtypes.
So you cannot extend State from other files, but if you prepare a type like `trait UserDefinedState extends State` 
users will still be able to define more sub-types of `UserDefinedState`, even from other files.
If you want to prevent this from happening, you should make your sub-types `final`, like we do in this example.
====

Having those prepared, let's finally dive in into using them as Phantom Types.
First let's define a class Service, which takes `State` type parameter - notice here that we _don't use any value of type S_ in this class_!
It's just there, unused, like a ghost, or _Phantom_ - which is where it's name comes from.

```scala
class Service[State <: ServiceState] private () {
  def start[T >: State <: Stopped]() = this.asInstanceOf[Service[Started]]
  def stop[T >: State <: Started]() = this.asInstanceOf[Service[Stopped]]
}
object Service {
  def create() = new Service[Stopped]
}
```

So in the companion object we create a new instance of the Service, at first it is `Stopped`.
The Stopped state conforms to the type bounds of the type parameter (`<: ServiceState`) so it's all good.

The interesting things happen when we want to start / stop an existing Service. The Type bounds defined on the start method for example,
are only valid for one value of `T`, which is `Stopped`. The transition to the opposite state is a no-op in our example, we return the same instance,
and explicitly cast it into the required state. Since nothing is actually using this type, you won't bump into class cast exceptions during this conversion.

Let's now investigate the above code using the REPL, which will act as a nice finisher for this section.

scala> val initiallyStopped = Service.create() <1>
initiallyStopped: Service[Stopped] = Service@337688d3

scala> val started = initiallyStopped.start()  <2>
started: Service[Started] = Service@337688d3

scala> val stopped = started.stop()            <3>
stopped: Service[Stopped] = Service@337688d3

scala> stopped.stop()                          <4>
<console>:16: error: inferred type arguments [Stopped] do not conform to method stop's 
                     type parameter bounds [T >: Stopped <: Started]
              stopped.stop()
                      ^

scala> started.start()                         <5>
<console>:15: error: inferred type arguments [Started] do not conform to method start's 
                     type parameter bounds [T >: Started <: Stopped]
              started.start()
----
<1> Here we create the initial instance, it starts in `Stopped` state
<2> Starting a `Stopped` service is OK, returned type is `Service[Started]`
<3> Stopping a `Started` service is OK, returned type is `Service[Stopped]`
<4> However stopping an already stopped service (`Service[Stopped]`) is not valid, and will not compile. Notice the printed type bounds!
<5> Similarly, starting an already started service (`Service[Started]`) is not valid, and will not compile. Notice the printed type bounds!

As you see, Phantom Types are yet another great facility to make our code even more type-safe (or shall I say "state-safe"!?).

TIP: If you're curious where these things are used in "not very crazy libraries", a great example here is http://github.com/foursquare/rogue[Foursquare Rogue] (the MongoDB query DSL) where it's used to assure a query builder is in the right state - for example that `limit(3)` was called on it.
