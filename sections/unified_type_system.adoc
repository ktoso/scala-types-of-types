== Unified Type System - Any, AnyRef, AnyVal

We refer to a Scala's typesystem as being "unified" because there is a "Top Type", `Any`. **This is different than Java**, which has "special cases" in form of primitive types (`int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, `boolean`), which do not extend Java's "Almost-Top Type" - `java.lang.Object`.

Scala takes on the idea of having one common Top Type for all Types by introducing `Any`. `Any` is a supertype of both `AnyRef` and `AnyVal`.

`AnyRef` is the "object world" of Java (and the JVM), it corresponds to `java.lang.Object`, and is the supertype of all objects.

`AnyVal` represents the "value world" of Java, such as `int` and it's friends.

Thanks to this hierarchy, we're able to define methods taking `Any` - thus being compatible with both `scala.Int` instances as well as `java.lang.String`:

```scala
class Person

val allThings = ArrayBuffer[Any]()

val myInt = 42             // Int, kept as low-level `int` during runtime

allThings += myInt         // Int (extends AnyVal)
                           // has to be boxed (!) -> becomes java.lang.Integer in the collection (!)

allThings += new Person()  // Person (extends AnyRef), no magic here
```

For the Typesystem it's transparent, though on the JVM level once we get into `ArrayBuffer[Any]` our Int instances will have to be packed into objects. Let's investigate the above example's by using the Scala REPL and it's `:javap` command (which shows the generated bytecode for our test class):

```
35: invokevirtual #47  // Method myInt:()I
38: invokestatic  #53  // Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
41: invokevirtual #57  // Method scala/collection/mutable/ArrayBuffer.$plus$eq:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/mutable/ArrayBuffer;
```

You'll notive that `myInt` is still carrying the value of a `int primitive` (this is visible as `I` at the end of the `myInt:()I` *invokevirtual* call). Then, right before adding it to the ArrayBuffer, scalac inserted a call to `BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer` (a small hint for not frequent bytecode readers, the method it calls is: `public Integer boxToInteger(i: int)`). This way, by having a smart compiler and treating everything as an object in this common hierarchy we're able to get away from the "but primitives are different" edge-cases, at least at the level of our Scala source code - the compiler takes care of it for us. On JVM level, the distinction is still there of course, and scalac will do it's best to keep using primitives wherever possible, as operations on them are faster, and take less memory (objects are obviously bigger than primitives).


On the other hand, we can limit a method to only be able to work on "lightweight" Value Types:

```scala
def check(in: AnyVal) = ()

check(42)    // Int -> AnyVal
check(13.37) // Double -> AnyVal

check(new Object) // -> AnyRef = fails to compile

```

In the above example I've used a TypeClass `Checker[T]` and a type bound, which will be discussed below. The general idea is that this method will only take value classes, be it Int or our own Value Type. While probably not used very often, it shows how nicely the typesystem embraces java primitives, and brings them into the "real" type system, and not as a separate case, as is the case with Java.
