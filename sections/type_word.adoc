== Type of an `object`

Scala `object`s are implemented via classes (obviously - as it's the basic building block on the JVM),
but you'll notice that we cannot get its type the same way as we would with an simple class...

I surprisingly often, would get the question on how to pass an object into a method. Just saying `obj: ExampleObj` won't work
because that's already referring to the instance, so there's a member called `type` which should be used in such cases.

How it might look like in your code is explained by the below example:

```
object ExampleObj

def takeAnObject(obj: ExampleObj.type) = {}

takeAnObject(ExampleObj)
```
