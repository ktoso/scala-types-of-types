== Type of an `object`

Scala ``object``s are implemented via classes (obviously - as it's the basic building block on the JVM),
but you'll notice that we cannot get its type the same way as we would with a simple class...

Surprisingly, I often get asked how to pass an object into a method. Just saying `obj: ExampleObj` won't work
because that's already referring to the instance, so there's a member called `type` which should be used in such cases.

The sample code below shows the required usage:

```scala
object ExampleObj

def takeAnObject(obj: ExampleObj.type) = {}

takeAnObject(ExampleObj)
```
