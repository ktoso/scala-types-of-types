== Type Variance in Scala

Variance, in general, can be explained as "type compatible-ness" between types, forming an `extends` relation.
The most popular cases where you'll have to deal with this is when working with containers or functions (so... surprisingly often!).

A major difference from Java in Scala is that container types are **not-variant by default**!
This means that if you have a container defined as `Box[A]`, and then use it with a `Fruit` in place
of the type parameter `A`, you will not be able to insert an `Apple` (which _IS-A_ `Fruit`) into it.

Variance in Scala is defined by using `+` and `-` signs in front of type parameters.

| Invariant     | C[T'] and C[T] are **not** related | C[T]
| Covariant     | C[T'] is a subclass of C[T]        | C[+T]
| Contravariant | C[T] is a subclass of C[T']        | C[-T]

The above table ilustrates all variance cases we'll have to worry about - in an abstract way.
In case you're wondering where you'd have to care about this - in fact, you're exposed to this each time 
you're working with collections you're being faced with the question "is it covariant?".

NOTE: Most __immutable__ collections are __covariant__, and most __mutable__ collections are __invariant__.

There are (at least) two nice and very intuitive examples of this in Scala. One being "any collection", where we'll use a `List[+A]` as our example, and functions. When talking about `List` in Scala, we usually mean `scala.collection.immutable.List[+A]`, which is immutable as well as covariant, let's look how this relates to building lists containing items of different types.

```scala
class Fruit
case class Apple() extends Fruit
case class Orange() extends Fruit

val l1: List[Apple] = Apple() :: Nil
val l2: List[Fruit] = Orange() :: l1

// and also, it's safe to prepend with "anything",
// as we're building a new list - not modifying the previous instance

val l3: List[AnyRef] = "" :: l2
```

It's worth mentioning that while **having immutable collections co-variant is __safe__**, the same cannot be said about mutable collections. The classic example here is `Array[T]` which is **invariant**. Let's look at what invariance means for us here, and how it saves us from mistakes:

```scala
// won't compile
val a: Array[Any] = Array[Int](1, 2, 3)
```

Such an assignment won't compile, because of Array's invariance. If this assignment would be valid, we'd run into the problem of being able to write such code: `a(0) = "" // ArrayStoreException!` which would fail with the dreaded `ArrayStoreException`.

TIP: We said that "most" immutable collections are covariant in scala. In case you're curious, one example of an immutable collection which stands out from that, and is invariant, it's `Set[A]`.
