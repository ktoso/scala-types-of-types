Links and Kudos
---------------

Obvisouly this vademecum required quite a bit of reseach and double-checking, so here are all the links I've found helpful (and you might too).

* Twitter's Scala School: http://twitter.github.io/scala_school quite a bit of Scala concepts. Which helped me a lot in nicely explaining Variance (nicest explanation I found, since "ever").
* Very old, but still valid explanation of Universal Types: http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/128
* Existential Types by D.R. MacIver: http://www.drmaciver.com/2008/03/existential-types-in-scala/
* Scala Doc: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html
* Wikipedia on the Diamond Problem: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_problem#The_diamond_problem
* Safari Books online about Type Linearization: http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/05/30/traits-how-scala-tames-multiple-inheritance/
* One of the first blogs about Phantom Types in Scala: http://blog.rafaelferreira.net/2008/07/type-safe-builder-pattern-in-scala.html
* Rogue (where I occasionally PullRequest too) is a great example of using Phantom Types: http://engineering.foursquare.com/2011/01/31/going-rogue-part-2-phantom-types/
* Great StackOverflow answer by **Kriss Nuttycombe** about Type Lambdas: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8736164/what-are-type-lambdas-in-scala-and-what-are-their-benefits
