== Abstract Type Member

Let's now go deeper into the use cases of Type Aliases, which we call Abstract Type Members.

With Abstract Type Members we say "I expect someone to tell me about some type - I'll refer to it by the name MyType".
It's most basic function is allowing us to define generic classes (templates), but instead of using the `class Clazz[A, B]` syntax, we name them inside the class, like this:

```scala
trait SimplestContainer {
  type A      // Abstract Type Member

  def value: A
}
```

Which for Java folks may seem very similar to the `Container<A>` syntax at first, but it's a bit more powerful as we'll see in the section about <<path-dependent-type, Path Dependent Types>>, as well as in the below example.

It is important to notice that while "Abstract Type Member" contains the word "abstract", it does not behave exactly like an abstract field - so you can still create a new instance of `SimplestContainer` without "implementing" the type member `A`:

```scala
new SimplestContainer // valid, but A is "anything"
```

You might be wondering what type `A` was bound to, since we didn't provide any information about it anywhere.
Turns out `type A` is actually just a shorthand for `type A >: Nothing <: Any`, which means "anything".

```scala
object IntContainer extends SimplestContainer {
  type A = Int

  def value = 42
}
```

So we "provide the type" using a <<type-alias, Type Alias>>, and now we can implement the value method which returns an `Int`.

The more interesting uses of Abstract Type Members start when we apply constraints to them. For example imagine you want to have a container that can only store anything that is of a `Number` instance. Such constraint can be annotated on a type member right where we defined it first:

```scala
trait OnlyNumbersContainer {
  type A <: Number
  def value: A
}
```

Or we can add constraints later on in the class hierarchy, for example by mixing in a trait that states "only Numbers":

```scala
trait SimpleContainer {
  type A
  def value: A
}

trait OnlyNumbers {
  type A <: Number
}

val ints = new SimpleContainer with OnlyNumbers {
  type A = Integer
  def value = 12
}

// bellow won't compile
val _ = new SimpleContainer with OnlyNumbers {
  def value = "" // error: type mismatch; found: String(""); required: this.A
}
```

So, as you can see we can use Abstract Type members, in similar situations like we use Type Parameters, but without the pain of having to pass them around explicitly all the time - the passing around happens because it is a field. The price paid here though is that we bind those types by-name.
