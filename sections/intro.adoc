== The different types of... Types in Scala

This blog post came into being after a few discussions about Types in Scala after some of JavaOne's parties in 2013. After those discussions I figured that many questions are often repeated by different people, during their learning of Scala. I though that we didn't have a full list of all tricks what we can to with Types in Scala, so I decided to write such a list - giving real life examples why we'd need these types.

== WORK IN PROGRESS

While I'm working on this article since quite some time, there's still MUCH to do!
For example Higher Kinds need a rewrite, there's a lot of detail to be added in Self Type's and lots and lots more. Check the todo file for more.

If you'd like to help, please do! I'll welcome any pull request, or suggestion (well, I'd prefer pull requests ;-).
