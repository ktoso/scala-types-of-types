In general
 - Consider grouping type types into "big boxes" - is it possible to split types into groups of types?
 - I can go tomorrow over the things below.

Page 2
 - I think the the use of inferred on the example can be a bit muddied:
 "// without Type Annotation, the type is inferred to be `Thing`
  val inferred = getThing"
Maybe an example of a different domain?
 "trait Dog
  def getDog = new Dog
  // without Type Annotation, the type of laika is inferred to be `Dog`
  val laika = getDog"

 - "It it a parameter" -> "Is it a parameter"
 - "Is it a public methods return value?" -> Add ' or revert phrase.
 - "Related hint: Including Type Annotations speeds up compilation, also it's generally nice to see the return type of a method." -> I would personally put these two ideas in the next paragraph, saying something like "Best practices are ... for ... reasons"

Page 3
 - "typesystem" or "type system"?
 - Java primitive list is missing char

Page 4
 - I really like the style of the example at the beginning of this page, the comments clarly showing what´s going on under the bonnet.
 - "This way, by having a smart compiler and treating everything as an object in this common hierarchy we're able to get away from the "but primitives are different" edge-cases, at least at the level of our Scala source code - the compiler takes care of it for us." -> I think this is too hard to read due to length, consider breaking it down. Also, I would say "but primitives are different" sounds a bit whiny, I would remove the "but".

Page 5
 - "(interresting)." -> "(interesting)."

Page 6
 - I would talk about calling type with the verbose option before the example, as in "by using :type again on it with the verbose option to get some extra info..."
 - Last phrase I would remove the "I" and make the subject of the phrase the example ("This example nicely exemplifies the core functionality...")

Page 7
 - Maybe break "Coming back to the subject why the common Type for our if statement with an AnyVal on one code block and a null on the other one was Any and not something else" down into two?
 - "obviously" as an adverb is modifying the verb "implemented", which I´m not sure if it´s what you are going for. Maybe substitute for "As it is obvious, since it is..."?
 - "I surprisingly often, would get the question..." -> "I surprisingly often get the question..." | "A question that often appears is..."
 - "How it might look like in your code is explained by the bellow example:" -> I would join with the previous paragraph and revert it: "You can see how the code would look on the below example"
 - On type variance, I would try to elaborate a bit more at the beginning - don't make paragraphs with a single line.

Page 8
 - "One being "any collection", where we'll use a List[A] as our example, and functions." -> Don´t understand the "and functions" at the end.
 - "Scala..., which..., under..." -> I feel this phrase has bad rythm, try not make it a bit more fluid: "Scala has Traits, which in other languages -such as Ruby- are known with the name of Mixins"
 - "First..." -> maybe it´s a good idea to explain what a trait is before going on into detail?

Page 9
 - "diamond problem" or "The Diamond Problem"
 - A reader could ask, why are we not sure? Also, the usage of "Basically" feels colloquial. "Basically "The Diamond Problem" is a situation during multiple inheritance where we're not sure to what we want to refer to."

Page 10
 - "This introduces an ambiguity when calling the common method in D , did we inherit the version of the method from C or from B ?" -> Make point of view homogeneous.
 - What is "In Scala's case the case with only one overriding method is very simple - the override wins." referring to?
 - "theone" -> "the one"
 - "amgiguity" -> "ambiguity"
 - "always (and deterministically) able to determine what will be called" -> "always able to deterministically identify which method implementation will be called"
 - On the examples, I would do away with the asserts, make it more like the previous ones.

Page 11
 - "right most" -> "rightmost"
 - "an simpliﬁcation, which while helpful, does not" -> "a simpliﬁcation which, while helpful, does not" 
 - "So for example in our case ( D1 ), the superclass of C is B." -> What about poor D2? You could say smthing such as "and viceversa fro D2" to keep symmetry.

Page 12
 - "Using this trick the ### deﬁnition now suddenly "makes sense!" -> Disagree, have no idea what just happened :P Explain more!
 - "Let's now go deeper into the..." -> I would remove the "taking the readers along" metaphor, it is very difficult to maintain on a long and technically deep text.

Page 13
 - "an Type" -> "a Type"

Page 14
 - All text under Type constructor I found difficult to parse.
 - "requireing" -> "requiring"
 - "Let's look at an example where a service, requires some Module, which provides other..." -> remove both commas
 - "should also keep in mind, that it's OK, to specify" -> remove both commas

Page 15
 - "Phantom Types are a mean of staticly validating your sources, during compile time. It's used in many libraries, to prevent you from using some API, with an object in "not the right state" -> kill all the commas!
 - "used this trick before" -> did we? Link back to section maybe?

Page 16
 - "why this us so nice interesting... [example] ...And we can do the" -> you didn´t tell the reader why it was so nice/interesting, something like ¨Look at the type of the parameter..."
 - I would join the example for stop to the start one and expand on the case for either (smthing like "What if you need to accept parameters in a subset of states...")
 - "which is quite a good comparation..." -> "comparation" is not a good word here. Maybe something "which is a good way of getting some intuition on them"?

Page 17
 - Love the example, but don´t understand "//takes a java.io.File (implements Closeable)"
 - "Another fact " -> "An important fact" 
 - "investitage the generated bytecode for scala (or java) classes, by using :javap in the Scala REPL, so you can check it out yourself." -> "investigate" and remove commas.
 - "stype" -> "style"
 - "be - a" -> "be a"

Page 18
 - "So using this type alias, we've made the def way cleaner" -> "By using this type alias we've made the def way cleaner"
 - Repeated the performance warning, either remove or lampshade/excuse the repeat.

Page 20
 - Remove extra commas from inside "Type Projection" section
 - Also, I would expect programmers to know how to say "#", so remove "(hash sign, pound sign)"
 - On existential types, I feel the example is difficult to understand on its own, and the explanation expects a lot from the reader.
 - "We know though that List is a type constructor, * -> *" -> do we? I would try to expand on this paragraph and make it more accessible.

Page 21
 - You said the "M" word! Scary! Is it possible to have a more pedestrian example?

Page 22
 - "via importing" -> "by importing"

Page 23
 - This sounds a bit weird -> "You can try it out (it's copy paste ready) in your Scala 2.10+ REPL - if you don't have one at hand: yeah, the output would be:" -> just say somehting like "The output would be"

Page 24
 - "Yeah, you ﬁgured it out already I guess." -> Well no, I didn´t...
 - "usualy" -> "usually"
